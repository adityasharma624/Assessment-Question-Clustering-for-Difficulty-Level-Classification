More specifically, <code>statements[i][j]</code> could be one of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>0</code> which represents a statement made by person <code>i</code> that person <code>j</code> is a <strong>bad</strong> person.</li>\n\t<li><code>1</code> which represents a statement made by person <code>i</code> that person <code>j</code> is a <strong>good</strong> person.</li>\n\t<li><code>2</code> represents that <strong>no statement</strong> is made by person <code>i</code> about person <code>j</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, no person ever makes a statement about themselves.
