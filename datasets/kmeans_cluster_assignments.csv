567,"maximum vacation days leetcode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among n cities to collect algorithm problems. but all work and no play makes jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow. rules and restrictions: you can only travel among n cities, represented by indexes from 0 to n-1. initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on monday. the cities are connected by flights. the flights are represented as a n*n matrix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. if there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i. you totally have k weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. you can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's monday morning. since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time. for each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an n*k matrix called days representing this relationship. for the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j. you're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the maximum vacation days you could take during k weeks. example 1: input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]] output: 12 explanation: ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. one of the best strategies is: 1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day. (although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is monday.) 2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days. 3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days. example 2: input:flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]] output: 3 explanation: ans = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. since there is no flights enable you to move to another city, you have to stay at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks. for each week, you only have one day to play and six days to work. so the maximum number of vacation days is 3. example 3: input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]] output: 21 explanation:ans = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 one of the best strategies is: 1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days. 2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on monday, and play 7 days. 3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on monday, and play 7 days. note: n and k are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100]. in the matrix flights, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1]. in the matrix days, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7]. you could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days. if you fly from the city a to the city b and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city b in that week. we don't consider the impact of flight hours towards the calculation of vacation days. topics: dynamic programming",1,1,3,1,4,5

635,"exclusive time of functions on a single-threaded cpu, we execute a program containing `n` functions. each function has a unique id between `0` and `n-1`. function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its id is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its id is popped off the stack. the function whose id is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the id, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp. you are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `ith` log message formatted as a string `""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}""`. for example, `""0:start:3""` means a function call with function id `0` started at the beginning of timestamp `3`, and `""1:end:2""` means a function call with function id `1` ended at the end of timestamp `2`. note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively. a function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. for example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for `2` time units and another call executing for `1` time unit, the exclusive time is `2 + 1 = 3`. return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the `ith` index represents the exclusive time for the function with id `i`. example 1: input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""1:start:2"",""1:end:5"",""0:end:6""] output: [3,4] explanation: function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1. function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5. function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time. so function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing. example 2: input: n = 1, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""0:start:6"",""0:end:6"",""0:end:7""] output: [8] explanation: function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself. function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time. function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again. function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time. function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time. so function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing. example 3: input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:6"",""1:end:6"",""0:end:7""] output: [7,1] explanation: function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself. function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time. function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1. function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 units of time, and ends at the end of time 6. function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time. so function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing. example 4: input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:7"",""1:end:7"",""0:end:8""] output: [8,1] example 5: input: n = 1, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:end:0""] output: [1] constraints: `1 <= n <= 100` `1 <= logs.length <= 500` `0 <= function_id < n` `0 <= timestamp <= 109` no two start events will happen at the same timestamp. no two end events will happen at the same timestamp. each function has an `""end""` log for each `""start""` log. topics: stack",1,1,3,1,5,5

721,"remove comments given a c++ program, remove comments from it. the program `source` is an array where `source[i]` is the `i`-th line of the source code. this represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character `\n`. in c++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments. the string `//` denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored. the string `/*` denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of `*/` should be ignored. (here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) to be clear, the string `/*/` does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning. the first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string `//` occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. similarly, if the string `/*` occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored. if a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty. there will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters. for example, `source = ""string s = ""/* not a comment. */"";""` will not be a test case. (also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.) it is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so `/*` outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment. finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. please see the examples below for details. after removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format. example 1: input: source = [""/*test program */"", ""int main()"", ""{ "", "" // variable declaration "", ""int a, b, c;"", ""/* this is a test"", "" multiline "", "" comment for "", "" testing */"", ""a = b + c;"", ""}""] the line by line code is visualized as below: /*test program */ int main() { // variable declaration int a, b, c; /* this is a test multiline comment for testing */ a = b + c; } output: [""int main()"",""{ "","" "",""int a, b, c;"",""a = b + c;"",""}""] the line by line code is visualized as below: int main() { int a, b, c; a = b + c; } explanation: the string `/*` denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. the string `//` denotes line 4 as comments. example 2: input: source = [""a/*comment"", ""line"", ""more_comment*/b""] output: [""ab""] explanation: the original source string is ""a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b"", where we have bolded the newline characters. after deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string ""ab"", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [""ab""]. note: the length of `source` is in the range `[1, 100]`. the length of `source[i]` is in the range `[0, 80]`. every open block comment is eventually closed. there are no single-quote, double-quote, or control characters in the source code. topics: string",1,2,0,2,5,2

(an integer could be positive or negative.) a let-expression takes the form `(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)`, where `let` is always the string `""let""`, then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable `v1` is assigned the value of the expression `e1`, the second variable `v2` is assigned the value of the expression `e2`, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression `expr`. an add-expression takes the form `(add e1 e2)` where `add` is always the string `""add""`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`. a mult-expression takes the form `(mult e1 e2)` where `mult` is always the string `""mult""`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`. for the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. a variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. additionally for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", or ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names. finally, there is the concept of scope. when an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. it is guaranteed that every expression is legal. please see the examples for more details on scope. evaluation examples: input: (add 1 2) output: 3 input: (mult 3 (add 2 3)) output: 15 input: (let x 2 (mult x 5)) output: 10 input: (let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y)))) output: 14 explanation: in the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x, we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate. since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3. input: (let x 3 x 2 x) output: 2 explanation: assignment in let statements is processed sequentially. input: (let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y)) output: 5 explanation: the first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x. the second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5. input: (let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x)) output: 6 explanation: even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context of the final x in the add-expression. that final x will equal 2. input: (let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2) output 4 explanation: variable names can contain digits after the first character. note: the given string `expression` is well formatted: there are no leading or trailing spaces, there is only a single space separating different components of the string, and no space between adjacent parentheses. the expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer. the length of `expression` is at most 2000.

1116,"building h2o there are two kinds of threads, `oxygen` and `hydrogen`. your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules. there is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given `releasehydrogen` and `releaseoxygen` methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. these threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must be able to immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. you must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do. in other words: if an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it has to wait for two hydrogen threads. if a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it has to wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread. we don’t have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; that is, the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. the key is just that threads pass the barrier in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bond and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads. write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints. example 1: input: ""hoh"" output: ""hho"" explanation: ""hoh"" and ""ohh"" are also valid answers. example 2: input: ""oohhhh"" output: ""hhohho"" explanation: ""hohhho"", ""ohhhho"", ""hhohoh"", ""hohhoh"", ""ohhhoh"", ""hhoohh"", ""hohohh"" and ""ohhohh"" are also valid answers. constraints: total length of input string will be 3n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. total number of `h` will be 2n in the input string. total number of `o` will be n in the input string. topics: nan",1,1,3,1,4,5

1777,"shortest path in a hidden grid this is an interactive problem. there is a robot in a hidden grid, and you are trying to get it from its starting cell to the target cell in this grid. the grid is of size `m x n`, and each cell in the grid is either empty or blocked. it is guaranteed that the starting cell and the target cell are different, and neither of them is blocked. you want to find the minimum distance to the target cell. however, you do not know the grid's dimensions, the starting cell, nor the target cell. you are only allowed to ask queries to the `gridmaster` object. thr `gridmaster` class has the following functions: `boolean canmove(char direction)` returns `true` if the robot can move in that direction. otherwise, it returns `false`. `void move(char direction)` moves the robot in that direction. if this move would move the robot to a blocked cell or off the grid, the move will be ignored, and the robot will remain in the same position. `boolean istarget()` returns `true` if the robot is currently on the target cell. otherwise, it returns `false`. note that `direction` in the above functions should be a character from `{'u','d','l','r'}`, representing the directions up, down, left, and right, respectively. return the minimum distance between the robot's initial starting cell and the target cell. if there is no valid path between the cells, return `-1`. custom testing: the test input is read as a 2d matrix `grid` of size `m x n` where: `grid[i][j] == -1` indicates that the robot is in cell `(i, j)` (the starting cell). `grid[i][j] == 0` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is blocked. `grid[i][j] == 1` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is empty. `grid[i][j] == 2` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is the target cell. there is exactly one `-1` and `2` in `grid`. remember that you will not have this information in your code. example 1: input: grid = [[1,2],[-1,0]] output: 2 explanation: one possible interaction is described below: the robot is initially standing on cell (1, 0), denoted by the -1. - master.canmove('u') returns true. - master.canmove('d') returns false. - master.canmove('l') returns false. - master.canmove('r') returns false. - master.move('u') moves the robot to the cell (0, 0). - master.istarget() returns false. - master.canmove('u') returns false. - master.canmove('d') returns true. - master.canmove('l') returns false. - master.canmove('r') returns true. - master.move('r') moves the robot to the cell (0, 1). - master.istarget() returns true. we now know that the target is the cell (0, 1), and the shortest path to the target cell is 2. example 2: input: grid = [[0,0,-1],[1,1,1],[2,0,0]] output: 4 explanation: the minimum distance between the robot and the target cell is 4. example 3: input: grid = [[-1,0],[0,2]] output: -1 explanation: there is no path from the robot to the target cell. constraints: `1 <= n, m <= 500` `m == grid.length` `n == grid[i].length` `grid[i][j]` is either `-1`, `0`, `1`, or `2`. there is exactly one `-1` in `grid`. there is exactly one `2` in `grid`. topics: depth-first search,breadth-first search,graph",1,1,3,1,4,6
